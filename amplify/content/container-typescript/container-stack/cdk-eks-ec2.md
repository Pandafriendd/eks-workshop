### Step 1. Add a EKS-EC2 to your stack

* ðŸŽ¯ EKS-EC2 ...


{{<highlight typescript "hl_lines=4-5 20-47">}}
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';

import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2';
{{</highlight>}}


## Step 2. CDK Diff

Save your code, and let's take a quick look at the `cdk diff` before we deploy:

```
npm run build

cdk diff CdkEksStack
```


## Step 3. Let's deploy

```
cdk deploy CdkEksStack
```

ðŸŽ¯ Once the CDK is deployed successfully, go to the [CloudFormation](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-southeast-1#/), select the `CdkEksStack` stack and go to the outputs section to copy the value from the field **~~Cluster~~ConfigCommand**; e.g. `EKSEC2ConfigCommand`.

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name EKS-EC2 --region ap-southeast-1 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::XXX
```
